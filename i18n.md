# Internationalization (i18n)

We are using [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to assert that the internationalized content can be loaded or that it gets rendered when the language changes.

## Translation Files

The translation json files for `en` and `zh` are located at `src/locales/en/translation.json` and `src/locales/zh/translation.json` respectively. By default, `zh` is used. If you have changes to the wordings, please make sure they are added or updated in both json files.

## Localized Path

Use ``getLocalizedPath`` to get the localized path. For example, if the current context locale is ``en``, the path would be ``/en/PATH_GOES_HERE``.

```js
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next"
import { getLocalizedPath } from "@/utils/i18n"
// ....
const { i18n } = useTranslation()
// ....
var path = getLocalizedPath(i18n, "/PATH_GOES_HERE")
```
